# Angular Material Bootstrap Template

## A personal template for my projects

This template was born to be a starting point for my personal projects and to practice with GIT.

If I find something interesting, for the development of any future projects, it will be added to the list below.

## About

The template is built with Angular and two CSS frameworks (Material & Bootstrap), which allow a smooth and linear development, according to Google's rules.
